# Architecture

This file can be used to detail:

* Architecture decisions.
* Future implementation details that cannot (or should not!) be attempted in the alotted time.

For accessibility:

I haven't checked the color contrast between light yellow bg color and search result text, it depends on what level of accessibility does client require.

Should give user some hints when loading, not sure if the aria-busy works, or maybe the loading image can be read by software.
